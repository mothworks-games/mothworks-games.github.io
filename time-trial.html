			This is my attempt at making an art program using Processing and giving it my own personal twist. While many other artistic programs offer the ability to draw whatever you want with all kinds of bells and whisltes like pressure sensitivity and importing images, this little experiment offers something none of those other programs have: a timer! Yes this is a game of sorts where you're given only one minute to draw what you want before it turns off your controls and you're left with your masterpiece. It definitely makes every last stroke count more. And hey, what art program can you say comes with a rat brush from the start?
