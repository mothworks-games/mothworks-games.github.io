				Read Only is a reimagined version of Web-Navi taken further. Rather than exploring web pages and such across the internet, you instead explore a run down computer riddled with viruses and corrupt programs. Through your ability to deduce what happened and solve puzzles, you are tasked with not only figuring out what happened, but fixing it. This is for one of your clients after all.
				<br>
				The game is still work in progress and very early on in development. The button below will take you to the itch.io page where you can go and take a look at it yourself.
