				Printed Knight
			</h4>
			<p>
				Made as an experiment with new tools, this piece is simply taking minecraft and creating a 3d printed statue based on the build. The subject in question is The Knight from Hollowknight, a game that I look up to for a multitude of reasons. This original print is very rudimentary and was made before I got a full grasp as to how this all worked. I do plan to create a larger and more detailed version in the future. When that is done, this bage will be updated to have it included in the pictures.
