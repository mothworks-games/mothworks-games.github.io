			Lost in Translation is a two part piece with only half able to be viewed via browser. The piece itself is a poster of code purposely made to be as poorly translated as possible, scattering it around a field of static with nonsense faintly in the background. The other half is the page itself translating the nonsense into a semblance of sense. The one tricky thing is that details of the piece itself is randomized with every time it's run. Colors are different, the squares move differently, and the word floating in this snowy void is randomized.
