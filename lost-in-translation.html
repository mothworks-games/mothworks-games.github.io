				Lost in Translation
			</h4>
			<p>
				Lost in Translation is a two part piece with only half able to be viewed via a browser. The piece itself is a poster of code purposely made to be as poorly translated as possible, making it seem like nonsense without taking the time to sift through and figure out what it means. The other half is the page itself translating the nonsense into a semblance of sense. The one tricky thing is that details of the piece itself is randomized with every time it's run. Colors are different, the squares move differently, and the word floating in this snowy void is randomized.
