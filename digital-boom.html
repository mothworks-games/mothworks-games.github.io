				This piece was actually made on accident while working on Cyberspace. I had run a sun and a green matrix style computer window through deep dream and wanted to tamper with it before putting it in the image. In the process, I made this and noticed how similar it looked to a mushroom cloud. I just liked it too much to discard, so I kept it and gave it a name. <br>
				
				It's when you get a name that you get attached to things, right?
