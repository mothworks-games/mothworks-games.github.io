			This piece is made more or less as a parody to the overall nature of very serious montages. What initially started as a test and time to refamiliarize myself with Adobe Premier slowly turned into realize just how easy it was to invoke emotion through the use of dramatic piano music and soft blurred transitions between clips of people looking whistfully off in the distance as though they were dealing with some serious emotional turmoil. The message is vague on purpose and is meant to leave room for anyone to attach one. In the end, it's something that's meant to grow absurdity and revel in it.
