		About the Artist
		</h1>
		<img src = "./images/bio_page.png" alt = "A rare productive day.">
		<p>My name is Thaddeus and I am an artist as well as a storyteller. I spend a lot of free time putting together stories and settings to use for one thing or another. Some find their way into my work, others sit as something planned for the future. I use art, most notably digital art, as a medium to share these stories in as many ways as I can. Be it through conveying personality in the character design or giving history to settings themselves that can be seen.</p>
		<p>When I'm not attempting to make a narrative to share with others, I'm playing with the tools available to me to make something I can only describe as parody. I'm very playful in my work, not wanting to focus on the nitty gritty details of life and societal turmoil that we absorb enough through media every day. There may be a few moments where I touch on a social issue, but for the most part the more serious works are about my personal musings on life.</p>
		<p>At the end of the day however, I want to get people to think when they look past the cartoon eyes and begin to look at the bits of symbolism.</p>
