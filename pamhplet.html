			The Pastafarian Pamphlet is a part of a performance art piece in which I made these little informational pamphlets, walked around the campus of SJSU dressed like a Mormon Missionary with a collander on my head, and attempted to hand them out and ask people if they'd like to hear about my religion. If this sounds a little familiar, it's because I was trying to poke fun at the people that do this with their religions, mostly Christianity.
		</p>

			Personally, I have no issue with any religion and I think anyone is allowed to practice whatever belief they choose. What I find annoying is people going on the sides of streets or finding anyone that might give a slight reply in attempts to discuss or convert me and sometimes others. It feels like the real world version of pop up ads on sites with how persistent they can be about this. So of course, in the spirit of good fun and general japery, I did this for an afternoon between classes and posted the remaining pamphlets up across the art building on the various corkboards outside of class. My only regret is that I wasn't more annoying about my approach.
